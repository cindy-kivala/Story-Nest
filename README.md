5. Add and save personal notes (non-persistent memory only)

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html

##  Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/cindy-kivala/story-nest.git
cd story-nest

2. Install and Run json-server
Ensure json-server is installed globally or in your project:

npm install -g json-server

# Start the server:
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
The books will be available at: http://localhost:3000/books

3. Open index.html in your browser
You can use Live Server (VS Code extension) or just double-click the file.

# Design Goals
- Easy-to-use single-page interface

- Minimal dependencies (vanilla JS)

- Fast, local development using json-server

- Meaningful feedback for user actions (alerts, console logs)

- Flexible search with no strict requirements for punctuation or casing

# Known Limitations
1. Notes are not persistent (by design): they're memory-only

2. No backend integration ‚Äî this is a front-end-only project

3. Image loading may depend on the formatting of the formats field in your book JSON

4. Only public domain books are available for use

#  Future Improvements
1. Convert note-saving to persistent storage

2. Add  further sorting ( Z-A,  popularity)
